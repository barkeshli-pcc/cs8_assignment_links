<body>
<p>Tokenize several large documents, store them in a Hash table using Open Addressing.</p>
<p>The user will enter a word and the program will display the paragraph(s) in which the word&nbsp;has appeared.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please give me a list of students you managed: For every student you are managing, I need to know what functions they wrote. Remember, from the CS2 students' perspective, this is a collaboration between a single student in CS2 and your team in CS8.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For every student in your CS8 team, I need to know what function each member performed.</p>
