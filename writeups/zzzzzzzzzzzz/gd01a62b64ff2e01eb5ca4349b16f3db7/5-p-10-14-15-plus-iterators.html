</head>
<body>
<p>See textbook for description.</p>
<p>submit a single project.</p>
<p>Implement an iterator as discussed in class</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure you have a cursor in your class so the user can call insert_before and insert_after or repeat the search.</p>
<p>The user should also be able to move the cursor back and forth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The end user must not be able to access any pointers to the actual nodes:</p>
<p>search simply moves the cursor to the found not or move cursor to the end if key is not found.</p>
