<h2><strong>Word Frequency:</strong></h2>
<p>Your program uses a large text file (use the&nbsp; as input.</p>
<p>Tokenizes the file and stores the words on an AVL along with the word's frequency.</p>
<p>Every time you go to insert a word into the tree, if it's already there, increment the frequency.</p>
<p>Then...</p>
<p>You copy the contents of the tree into a Max Heap based on frequency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point, the word with the highest frequency is at the top.</p>
<p>Now, print the top 100 most frequent words along with their frequency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both your AVL and Heap are standard structures. You will not make any modifications to these structures for this project.</p>
