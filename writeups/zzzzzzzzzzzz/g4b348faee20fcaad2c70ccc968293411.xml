  <title>Something from nothing</title>
  <text texttype="text/html">&lt;p&gt;Not entirely sure, but the Stephen Hawking quote might be referring to the following facts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the quantum level, something can and does come from nothing all of the time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some cosmologists claim that the net energy of the universe is zero (negative energy of gravity perfectly balances the positive energy of everything else)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, it's possible that our universe started from nothing and grew to its current size while maintaining the balance between increasing matter and positive energy with increasing gravity.&lt;/li&gt;
