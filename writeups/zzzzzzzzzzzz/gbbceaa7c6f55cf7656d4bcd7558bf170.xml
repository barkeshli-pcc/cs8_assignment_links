  <title>Rapid Response Emergency Aid</title>
  <text texttype="text/html">&lt;p&gt;Hello class,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based upon our last zoom session, I understand some of my fellow classmates are experiencing financial hardships because of the shut downs. Through the PCC scholarship foundation, students can apply for the Rapid Response Emergency Aid, amongst all of the other scholarships, that is aimed at assisting students in times of unforeseen financial emergencies. Below I have attached the link. I hope this can be of help to you all.&lt;/p&gt;
