</head>
<body>
<p>Design an AVL Tree class that includes the usual functions: Insert, Delete, Search, Inorder, &nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>COMMENT THIS PROGRAM TO DEATH!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every function will have a block that explains in detail what the function does, how does it do it and within the function every small block of code must be well documented. (Please do not take this part of the assignment lightly.)</p>
