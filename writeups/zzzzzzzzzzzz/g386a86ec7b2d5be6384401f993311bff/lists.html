<h3>class LinkedList:</h3>
<p>You will implement this class following this set of specifications EXACTLY&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Templated Node class (or struct):</strong></p>
<p>will have an item of the template variable T, and a next pointer of the Node&lt;T&gt; type. Leave these member variables as&nbsp;<span>public</span>.</p>
<p>You will be happier if &nbsp;you had a constructor for this class so that it could be easily initialized.</p>
<p><strong>Linked List functions header file</strong></p>
<p>This is NOT a class. This header file will contain functions that manipulate a linked list.</p>
<p>given that head is a pointer of type Node&lt;T&gt;, write a set of functions that will include at least this list:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>class Iterator&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Wrap the "walker" node pointer in a class. Define the normal operations such as the dereference operator, increment and decrement operators, equality comparison, test of "nullness" among others.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;List classes:</strong></p>
<p>Now, we wrap the head pointer in a class called List. The functions in this class will simply call the functions from the linked list functions header file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This separations will hopefully make it easier to develop various classes based on the same underlying functions.</p>
<p>the List classes will provide ways to insert, delete, search, and otherwise access the items in the nodes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using this method, define and implement the following classes:</p>
