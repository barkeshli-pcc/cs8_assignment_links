<div style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
<h2 style="color: #444;">Goal:</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Create a game involving an infinitely expanding 2d grid of tiles that you need to navigate in the cardinal directions (north, south, east, west). The tiles in this grid should be stored as a 2d doubly-linked list, starting with a 5x5 grid. This grid should be displayed in the console.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Each of these tiles is filled with a random word, which can be read either from an array or a .txt file.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">The goal of the game is to accumulate points by typing the words directly adjacent to the center of the screen. In the below example, typing "can" would net the player (1) point and move the center east. Invalid words or typos should result in a (5) point deduction.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">In the above example, (5) new tiles are created to the east of the existing 5x5 array. (6) random words are generated, including the tile we previously traveled from. When a random word is generated, it should come with the chance to spawn as a special tile. Here are some you can implement:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
<p style=" margin-bottom: 5px;">Blocked Tile (denoted with ASCII 219 ( )):</p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 20px;">
<li>Cannot be traversed by the player. If you are surrounded by 4 Blocked Tiles, you automatically lose.</li>
<li>~20% chance of spawning.</li>
</ul>
<p style=" margin-bottom: 5px;">Bonus Tile (denoted with asterisks (*)):</p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 20px;">
<li>Give additional points when scored. If a normal tile is (1) point, say bonus tiles are (5) points.</li>
<li>~20% chance of spawning.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Note that in the above example, the new dynamic array has dimensions of 5 rows x 6 columns. When printing the screen, however, you should only display a 5x5 grid around the current central tile. The tiles directly to the west of the visible screen should still exist in memory. If you decide to travel west once again, you should see the exact same tiles, with no new words created.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">See the following Google Sheet for a possible list of words to use. I recommend using the "Easy" list of words, with 55 total words. The max length of any words in this "Easy" list is 5 characters.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Also, see the below videos for demos of the original game, made using QT-Creator. This might give a better idea of what the game looks like when running.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">The following pages of this document are possible stages you can go through during your development of your program.</p>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
<h2 style="color: #444;">Stage 1:</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Create an initial 5x5 grid of tiles filled with random words, with a blank space in the center.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">No need to create blocked/bonus tiles. Save this for Stage 3.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Example Output:</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
<h2 style="color: #444;">Stage 2:</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Implement movement. Your program should verify if a user-inputted word is valid. If so, the grid should be shifted over in the corresponding direction.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">If there are not enough existing tiles to maintain a 5x5 grid around the central tile, a new row/column of tiles should be dynamically allocated. Random words should be inserted into each tile, whenever necessary.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Whenever you call the print_screen() function, it should only print the 5x5 grid around the central tile. Any tiles off-screen should still remain in memory.</p>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
<h2 style="color: #444;">Stage 3:</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Implement blocked/bonus tiles, as described in the "Goal" Section. They should be randomly distributed starting from the beginning of the game.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Also, track the current score. A valid word should give (1) point, a bonus word should give (5) points, and an invalid word/typo should subtract (5) points.</p>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
<h2 style="color: #444;">Extra Stage:</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Consider a timer or additional special tiles to add to the game. Alternatively, consider adding Words-Per-Minute, Accuracy%, or High Score trackers.</p>
