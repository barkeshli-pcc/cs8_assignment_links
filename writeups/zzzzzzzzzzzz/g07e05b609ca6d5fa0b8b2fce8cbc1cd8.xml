  <title>Stack / Queue project : initializing head function</title>
  <text texttype="text/html">&lt;p&gt;I've only just gotten started on this assignment, but I have noticed something a bit confusing in the instructions.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps somebody else could share their opinion on the matter with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In "list.h", we have this function signature:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;//initializes head to NULL&lt;br&gt;template &amp;lt;class T&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;node&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;* init_head(node&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;* &amp;amp;head);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, am I wrong to assume that we need to delete the rest of the nodes following head if we are going to do this?&amp;nbsp; I am under the impression that simply making head point to nullptr will cause the rest of the elements that could be in the "list" (aka stack or queue) to be lost in a memory leak.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I alone in thinking that initializing the head pointer to null for any stack or queue that has more than 0 elements is therefore basically the same thing as the delete all members function?&lt;/p&gt;</text>
