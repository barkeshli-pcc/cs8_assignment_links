<p>The Lab and Plane problem from CS3.</p>
<p>In three levels. Application, Lab and Plane Functions, Basic 2D array Functions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will write a set of functions to make use of two dimensional dynamic arrays simpler:</p>
<p>int** _allocate(int sizes[]);</p>
<p>bool _index_is_valid(sizes[], int row, int column)</p>
<p>functions for reading and writing into a two dimensional dynamic array (this could be done by simply addressing the cells with the bracket operator. But we are not using that simple approach because we need to be very comfortable using pointers.)</p>
<p>You may want to write a function that returns a pointer to a given cell in the 2D array:&nbsp;</p>
<p>int** _get(int** two_d, int *sizes, int row, int column)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
